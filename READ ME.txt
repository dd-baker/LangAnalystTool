This is a tool for doing a type of linguistic encoding that currently there are no applications for. 
Natomic analysis is encoding objects and relationships as image collections grouped by reference. 
The tool should allow someone to log into the site and choose to work or study.
If work is chosen, then they're to their account where they can either pull up a prior work or begin a new one with the chosen presets.
If study is chosen they can either look up past reports in a search system or investigate the instructional documents. 
When working the document saves the natomic units in a nested format that is highly conducive to templated analysis. 

This tool takes a 100 hour job and turns it into a 1 hour job and I am giddy at the prospect of having it on hand.
